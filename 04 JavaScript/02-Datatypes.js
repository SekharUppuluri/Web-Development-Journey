// ========== Data Types in JavaScript ==========
// JavaScript has several data types which can be categorized into two main types: Primitive and Non-Primitive (Reference) types.

// 1. Primitive Data Types:
// These are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They include:
/*
    a) Number
    b) String
    c) Boolean
    d) Undefined
    e) Null
    f) Symbol
    g) BigInt
*/  

// a) Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
let num = 42; 

// b) String: Represents a sequence of characters.
let greeting = "Hello, world!"; 

// c) Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
let isJavaScriptFun = true;  

// d) Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
let undefinedVar;

// e) Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
let nullVar = null; 

// f) Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value used as the key of an object property.
let sym = Symbol("unique"); 

// g) BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
let bigIntNum = 9007199254741991n;
